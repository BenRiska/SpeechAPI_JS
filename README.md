# SpeechAPI_JS
Text to speech translation app built with the window speech api (Vanilla javascript)

Recently i have been delving further into api's and how they work so i thought i would make a simple text -> speech translation app with the browsers built in speech api. It doesnt require any tokens or keys so the setup is pretty simple to set up. feel frer to use any components in your own work!
